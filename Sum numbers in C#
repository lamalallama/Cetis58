In C#, you can sum numbers using various methods depending on the data type and the context in which you want to perform the addition.
Here are some common ways to sum numbers in C#:

1. Summing Integers (int) or Floating-Point Numbers (double, float, decimal):

You can use simple addition (+) to sum two or more numbers of the same data type.

```csharp
int num1 = 5;
int num2 = 10;
int sum = num1 + num2;
Console.WriteLine("Sum: " + sum);
```

2. Summing Numbers in an Array:

If you have a collection of numbers, you can sum them using a loop, such as a `for` loop or a `foreach` loop.

```csharp
int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
int sum = 0;

foreach (int num in numbers)
{
    sum += num;
}

Console.WriteLine("Sum: " + sum);
```

3. Using LINQ (Language-Integrated Query):

You can also use LINQ to sum numbers in a collection easily:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;

int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
int sum = numbers.Sum();
Console.WriteLine("Sum: " + sum);
```

Make sure to include the `System.Linq` namespace for the above code to work.

4. Summing Numbers in a List or IEnumerable:

If you have a list or an IEnumerable collection, you can use LINQ as well:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

List<int> numbersList = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
int sum = numbersList.Sum();
Console.WriteLine("Sum: " + sum);
```

Again, make sure to include the necessary namespaces.

5. Summing Numbers from User Input:

You can sum numbers entered by the user by parsing their input as numbers and then adding them.

```csharp
using System;

int sum = 0;

Console.Write("Enter a number: ");
int num1 = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());

Console.Write("Enter another number: ");
int num2 = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());

sum = num1 + num2;
Console.WriteLine("Sum: " + sum);
```
